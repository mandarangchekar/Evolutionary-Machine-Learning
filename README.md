Overview

This repository contains materials for the course CIS 600: Introduction to Machine Learning and Algorithms at Syracuse University. It includes homework assignments, datasets, code, and reports for HW00 to HW04. The assignments are designed to provide practical experience with various machine learning algorithms and data processing techniques. Specifically, the code for HW01 to HW05 is written in Julia, while Python is used for HW06 to HW08. Each homework focuses on different aspects of machine learning and algorithms, emphasizing both theoretical understanding and practical application.

Assignments Description and Summary

HW00: Data Collection and Manipulation 

•	Algorithm: Data scraping and random data modification.
•	Summary: Selected a 2-class classification problem with at least ten input attributes and at least 1000 labeled data points. Trained a shallow feedforward neural network using backpropagation and summarized results with confusion matrices.

HW01: Evolution Strategies 

•	Algorithm: Evolution Strategies (ES) algorithm.
•	Summary: Applied ES for training the neural network, compared results with backpropagation, and plotted performance metrics.

HW02: Masked Neural Networks with Genetic Algorithms 

•	Algorithm: Genetic algorithm with fitness proportionate selection, linear ranking selection, deterministic tournament selection, or stud selection.
•	Summary: Trained a neural network with half of the connection weights masked, compared with a baseline algorithm, and evaluated the best results.

HW03: Differential Evolution 

•	Algorithm: Differential Evolution algorithm.
•	Summary: Applied differential evolution to the neural network training problem and compared results with previous homework assignments.

HW04: Particle Swarm Optimization
